                <h3 class="mt-4">Photography</h5>
                    <p>The photograph is evident in nearly every aspect of modern life. As a form of communication and
                        documentation, photographs are present in newspapers,
                        magazines, advertisements, posters, television, the Internet, passports, ID cards, archives,
                        security and Surveillance Systems, forensics and medicine.
                        Photography also plays an important role in domestic and recreational activities. Most
                        photographs produced today take the form of Snapshots
                        activities such as holidays and celebrations. With the prevalence of digital cameras and mobile
                        phone cameras, these activities are also
                        for display on photo-sharing websites and photo-based Social Networking Sites. Despite the
                        prevalence of photography in many aspects of modern life,
                        only a small minority of photographs are considered to be art and tend to be displayed in
                        museums and galleries in formats similar to painting.</p>

                <h3 class="mt-4">Phto Editting</h5>
                    <p>Photo editing is the act of image enhancement and manipulation. This process is usually done with a digital photo 
                        editing software. Photo editing can involve basic tweaks like when you crop and resize images or adjust saturation.
                         It also includes advanced techniques like swapping faces or photo retouching to get rid of distracting elements or unwanted objects.

                        Some image editing techniques are done manually, while others are conducted through automated photo editing tools and software. 
                        Most edits to digital photography involve some one or a few photo editing programs. Some edits are even done offline on actual photographs,
                         posters, or other printed collateral without any image editing software.

                    <p>Video can be a key component in your marketing.  It can be used to demonstrate your techniques and talents to clients. 
                         It is a great way to do some teaching to other photographers.  It can create an additional revenue stream for your business
                          even if it isn't your primary focus.  It can make you stand out among the other still photographers in your area.
                          Finally, let's face it whether its home videos, a flowing waterfall in a landscape, or even drone footageâ€¦video is just fun.

                        For all these reasons, I have taken the dive into video in the past year.  So, as someone who still considers himself a 
                         with video, I wanted to share some of the things I have learned with others photographers who are thinking about dipping their 
                         toes in.  This is certainly not an exhaustive tutorial on professional video shooting, but I hope that it can help some of you out
                          there get started.

                <p>Video editing is the manipulation and arrangement of video shots. Video editing is used to structure and present all video 
                    information, including films and television shows, video advertisements and video essays. Video editing has been dramatically
                     democratized in recent years by editing software available for personal computers. Editing video can be difficult and tedious, 
                     so several technologies have been produced to aid people in this task. Pen based video editing software was developed in order to
                      give people a more intuitive and fast way to edit video.[1]
